# Third-Party Notices

SomnoTrace is an independent, clean-room implementation. It does **not** copy
source code from the projects listed below. Those projects were used only as
**reference material** to understand reverse-engineered device and
communication protocols. Protocol facts and ideas are not protected by
copyright; only their original expression (source code) is. SomnoTrace's
implementation was written independently.

These acknowledgements are provided voluntarily in good faith to credit
the prior reverse-engineering work.  SomnoTrace is not a derivative work of
any project listed below — no source code was copied, adapted, or included.
Protocol facts (command codes, byte layouts, UUIDs, file-format structures)
are not protected by copyright.  The listings below are therefore not
required by any license obligation; they are provided for transparency and
to credit the researchers whose work informed SomnoTrace's independent
implementation.  License terms are recorded in case any incidental,
copyrightable material is ever determined to have been incorporated.

- **Source:** https://github.com/m-kozlowski/airbreak-plus
- **Referenced for:** understanding of ResMed AirSense BLE/data-protocol
  behaviour (notably the `docs/` and `python/` directories).
- **License:** MIT

## o2ring-s-protocol

- **Project:** o2ring-s-protocol
- **Source:** https://github.com/nglessner/o2ring-s-protocol
- **Referenced for:** understanding of the Wellue / O2 Ring S BLE protocol
  (Gen2, "OxyII").  Listed here for context alongside the Gen1 references
  below.
- **License:** MIT

## farolone/wellue-o2ring-protocol

- **Project:** wellue-o2ring-protocol
- **Source:** https://github.com/farolone/wellue-o2ring-protocol
- **Referenced for:** understanding of the Gen1 Wellue O2 Ring BLE protocol.
  This is a pure documentation project (no executable code) describing packet
  framing, command codes, GATT UUIDs, and the VLD3 file format.
- **License:** MIT
- **Notes:** Clean-room reference only.  No source code was copied — the
  repository contains only Markdown documentation.  Protocol facts (frame
  structure, command codes, UUIDs, VLD3 header/record layouts) were used to
  inform SomnoTrace's independent C implementation in `main/oximeter_legacy.c`.

## home-health-hub/viatom-o2ring-ble

- **Project:** viatom-o2ring-ble
- **Source:** https://github.com/home-health-hub/viatom-o2ring-ble
- **Referenced for:** understanding of the Gen1 Viatom/Wellue oxy-family BLE
  protocol (frame codec, CRC-8, response assembly, file-transfer flow, VLD3
  parsing, live-reading byte offsets, device discovery name-matching rules).
- **License:** GPL-3.0
- **Notes:** Clean-room reference only.  No source code was copied, adapted,
  or included in SomnoTrace.  The project was studied to understand protocol
  behaviour; SomnoTrace's implementation in `main/oximeter_legacy.c` was
  written independently in C for ESP-IDF/NimBLE and does not derive from the
  Python reference.  Listed here for transparency and to credit the
  reverse-engineering work; this listing is not a license obligation.

## MackeyStingray/o2r

- **Project:** o2r
- **Source:** https://github.com/MackeyStingray/o2r
- **Referenced for:** understanding of CMD_CONFIG write commands and the full
  VLD3 header field layout used by Gen1 O2 Ring devices.
- **License:** GPL-3.0
- **Notes:** Clean-room reference only.  No source code was copied, adapted,
  or included in SomnoTrace.  Protocol facts (command payloads, header field
  offsets) were used to inform SomnoTrace's independent implementation.
  Listed here for transparency and to credit the original reverse-engineering
  work; this listing is not a license obligation.

## ecostech/viatom-ble

- **Project:** viatom-ble
- **Source:** https://github.com/ecostech/viatom-ble
- **Referenced for:** understanding of Gen1 live-reading byte offsets and
  client connection lifecycle behaviour (inactivity timeout/disconnect
  patterns).
- **License:** MIT
- **Notes:** Clean-room reference only.  No source code was copied.  Protocol
  facts (notification byte layout, sensor-reading offsets) were used to inform
  SomnoTrace's independent implementation.

## Viatom LepuBle / LepuDemo SDKs

- **Project:** LepuBle / LepuDemo (Viatom official BLE SDKs)
- **Source:** https://github.com/viatom-develop/LepuBle ,
  https://github.com/viatom-develop/LepuDemo
- **Referenced for:** confirming GATT UUIDs, device protocol compatibility,
  and understanding the OxyII (Gen2) AES-128 session key negotiation and
  payload encryption mechanism.
- **License:** Proprietary (vendor SDKs of unclear licence terms)
- **Notes:** Clean-room reference only.  No source code was copied, adapted,
  or included in SomnoTrace.  Only protocol facts (command opcodes, XOR key
  derivation, AES-128-ECB payload handling) were used to inform SomnoTrace's
  independent C implementation.  Listed here for transparency; this listing is
  not a licence obligation.

  endpoint. This allows reproducible offline builds and timezone selection in
  SoftAP setup mode.

- **Referenced for:** Understanding European Data Format (EDF) compatibility
  requirements, signal channel mappings, and statistical calculation parity

## Interoperability / reverse-engineering note

SomnoTrace interoperates with third-party medical devices (e.g. ResMed
AirSense 11, Wellue O2 Ring) over their wireless interfaces. It is intended
for personal interoperability and data-portability purposes. The MIT-licensed
reference projects impose no commercial restrictions. The GPLv3-licensed
reference projects were studied for protocol understanding only; no source
code was copied, adapted, or included, so GPLv3 copyleft obligations are not
triggered. Reverse engineering for interoperability is recognised in many
jurisdictions (e.g. the EU Software Directive, US DMCA s.1201(f), and
interoperability provisions of Australia's Copyright Act 1968). This is not
legal advice; obtain professional advice before any commercial distribution.
