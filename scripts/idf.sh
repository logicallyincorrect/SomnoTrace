# ── Usage ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Thin wrapper that runs idf.py (or an arbitrary command) inside the official
# Espressif ESP-IDF Docker image. This pins the toolchain to a known version
# without installing the multi-GB SDK on the host. Docker is the only host
# dependency required to build.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/idf.sh build
#   ./scripts/idf.sh set-target esp32s3
#   ./scripts/idf.sh menuconfig
#   ./scripts/idf.sh -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash monitor
#   ./scripts/idf.sh                 # interactive shell in the container
#   ./scripts/idf.sh exec <cmd> ...  # run an arbitrary command in the container
#
