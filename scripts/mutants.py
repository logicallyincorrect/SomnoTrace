"""Does the host test suite actually notice when the code is wrong?

A test that asserts a constant copied from the implementation passes forever,
bug included.  This script plants a short list of *plausible* bugs — each one
a mistake this code base has had, nearly had, or could have with a one-line
slip — into a copy of main/, runs scripts/run_host_tests.sh against the copy,
and reports which mutants the suite killed.  A surviving mutant is a hole in
the tests, not (necessarily) a bug in the code.

Two controls decide whether the numbers mean anything at all:

  baseline  the unmutated tree must pass, with nothing skipped.  A suite that
            is already red, or that silently skipped the file under test,
            "kills" everything and measures nothing.
  canary    one mutant that no working suite can miss (every SNT file
            rejected).  If it survives, the run is VOID and no kill count is
            printed — a runner that always exits 0 would otherwise look like
            a perfect suite.

A kill needs positive evidence: the runner's final "host tests:" line, and
the name of the test that failed.  A compile error is not a kill (the mutant
was malformed); a missing summary line is not a kill (the runner did not
finish).  Each mutant is an exact-string replacement that must match exactly
once, so a refactor that moves the code fails loudly here instead of silently
testing nothing.  Expected-failure (XFAIL) tests cannot kill anything.

Usage: scripts/mutants.py [--only <id>] [--keep]
Exit status: non-zero if the run is VOID or any mutant survived / did not apply.
