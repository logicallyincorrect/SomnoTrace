/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Scheduler
 *
 *  Owns the upload task and decides what runs when.  Three triggers:
 *
 *   1. export complete   — the exporter reports a day; that day is rescanned
 *                          and, if anything is pending, uploaded now.
 *   2. periodic scan     — every SCAN_INTERVAL, reconciles the card against
 *                          the index.  This is what recovers after a crash or
 *                          a lost state file.  Nothing pending means nothing
 *                          is connected to.
 *   3. manual            — reset (clear state and re-upload, bounded by
 *                          max_days) or an explicit rescan from the Web UI.
 *
 *  Backends are independent: each has its own cursor, its own cooldown ladder
 *  and its own error.  A backend that fails twice in a run is put on cooldown
 *  and the next backend runs immediately, so an unreachable SMB share cannot
 *  hold up SleepHQ.  Nothing is ever abandoned permanently — attempts only
 *  drive the ladder, and the periodic scan keeps re-offering the work.
