/* These MUST mirror main/sd_storage.h.  The uploader is a component and the
 * app depends on it, not the other way round, so the paths cannot be included
 * from there.  Previously each backend defined its own copy; they live here so
 * there is exactly one place to change.
 *
 * The ResMed-compatible export tree is what gets uploaded:
 *
 *   SDCARD/DATALOG/<YYYYMMDD>/<prefix>_{BRP,PLD,SA2,EVE,CSL}.edf   session data
 *   SDCARD/STR.edf, Identification.json/.crc, SETTINGS files       root bundle
 */

/* Overridable so the scan logic can be exercised against a copy of a real
 * card on the host (see .ai test harness). */
