/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Scanner
 *
 *  Derives upload units from the SDCARD/ tree and reconciles them against
 *  the index.  This is the self-healing half of the design: whatever the
 *  index believes, the card is the truth about which files exist.
 *
 *  Session EDFs are immutable once renamed into place, so a group is
 *  identified by prefix and validated by (kinds, file count) only — no
 *  hashing, no stat.  Replacement of an existing export is an explicit
 *  event (rebuild-day / recreate-edfs), which calls
 *  upload_index_forget_day() rather than relying on the scan to notice.
 *
 *  The root bundle is different: STR.edf and friends are rewritten by every
 *  export, so they are fingerprinted by size+mtime.
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
