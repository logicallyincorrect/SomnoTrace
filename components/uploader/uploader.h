/* ── Upload backend interface ──────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Each backend (SMB, SleepHQ, future additions) implements this interface.
 * Only one backend runs at a time, to avoid memory contention between TLS
 * (SleepHQ) and SMB socket buffers.
 *
 * The interface is split into a connection scope, a day scope and a per-group
 * transfer so that tracking can be per group while the *transport* stays
 * batched: one connect per backend per run, and for SleepHQ one import per
 * day.  Per-group tracking must never become per-group connecting — that
 * would be slower than the day-level uploader it replaces.
 *
 * Call order driven by the scheduler:
 *
 *   session_begin()
 *     day_begin(day)                      for each day with pending groups
 *       put_group(day, group)             for each pending group only
 *       put_bundle(day, bundle, changed)  root files (see note below)
 *     day_end(day, any_uploaded)
 *   session_end()
 *
 * put_bundle() is offered once per day. The backend decides what to do with
 * it: SleepHQ must include the root files in every import for the sessions to
 * be interpretable, whereas SMB only needs to re-send them when `changed` is
 * true. Returning UPLOAD_OK for a deliberate skip is correct and expected. */
