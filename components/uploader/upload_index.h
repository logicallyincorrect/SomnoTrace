/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Upload tracking index
 *
 *  Tracks what has been uploaded at *group* granularity, independently
 *  per backend.
 *
 *  A "group" is the set of EDF files sharing one filename prefix, e.g.
 *  20260807_134405_{BRP,PLD,SA2}.edf.  Note that one therapy session
 *  normally produces TWO groups, because edf_gen names EVE/CSL from
 *  TherapyStart and BRP/PLD/SA2 from the _ZLE/MaskOn edge a few seconds
 *  later:
 *
 *      20260807_134400_{EVE,CSL}.edf     <- TherapyStart prefix
 *      20260807_134405_{BRP,PLD,SA2}.edf <- MaskOn prefix
 *
 *  The group is used as the tracking unit rather than the therapy session
 *  because it is derivable purely from the SDCARD/ tree that actually gets
 *  uploaded — no cross-referencing into the raw session store — which makes
 *  the self-healing scan a pure directory listing.  The two groups of a
 *  session upload back to back, so the practical granularity is the same.
 *
 *  Persistence: one small JSON file per day under UPLOAD_STATE_DIR, rewritten
 *  atomically (temp -> fsync -> rename) when that day changes.  JSON was
 *  chosen over a binary layout for debuggability; at a few hundred bytes per
 *  day the size difference does not matter, and a whole-file rewrite is
 *  cheaper than an append plus the replay/compaction machinery it would need.
 *  Pruning is a file unlink.
 *
 *  NOTE: UPLOAD_STATE_DIR must mirror SD_APP_DIR/upload_state in
 *  main/sd_storage.h (this component does not depend on main).
 * ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── */
