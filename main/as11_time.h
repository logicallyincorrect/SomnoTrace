/* ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *  Why this module exists
 *
 *  The AS11 defines its reporting day as noon-to-noon *in the device's own
 *  timezone*, and stamps every Summary record's PeriodStart at exactly noon
 *  local to itself.  The ESP has its own, independently configured timezone.
 *
 *  Deriving the noon-day by applying ESP local time to an AS11 timestamp is
 *  therefore wrong whenever the two zones differ: if the AS11 is one hour
 *  east of the ESP, AS11 noon is 11:00 ESP-local, which reads as "before
 *  noon" and rolls every record back a whole day.  The visible damage is
 *  MaskOn/MaskOff values above 1440 (which OSCAR rejects as card
 *  corruption), summary data attached to the wrong day, and the current day
 *  never appearing covered — see issue #75.
 *
 *  A previous fix handled the few-minutes NTP-drift variant of this by
 *  labelling from the raw AS11 clock; that is not enough, because with a
 *  timezone difference the raw AS11 value itself is no longer at ESP-local
 *  noon.
