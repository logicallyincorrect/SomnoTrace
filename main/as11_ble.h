 * Post-therapy spool data collection.  The AS11 stores session summaries,

 * notifications arrive asynchronously on the same BLE characteristic as

 * as11_ble_spool_pull() handles the full cycle: StartSpool →
 * PullSpoolFragments → collect SpoolFragment notifications → reassemble.
 * Multi-round pulls (SPOOL_COMPLETE_MORE_DATA_PENDING) are handled
 * automatically by looping with the nextSpoolAddress from the last
 * fragment.
 *
 * Returns ESP_OK on success.  *out_data is heap-allocated; caller frees.
 * Parameters:
 *   spool_type  - e.g. "Summary", "TherapyEvents-RespiratoryEvents"
 *   from_dt     - ISO-8601 start time, e.g. "2026-06-25T00:00:00.000Z"
 *   out_data    - receives malloc'd buffer with raw protobuf bytes
