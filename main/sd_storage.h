 * The card is shared by the raw writer, EDF generation, the uploader, FTP,

 * outranks everything else, so bulk and destructive work must declare
 * itself and can be refused while a session is recording.
 *
 * Roles:
 *   EXPORT      — EDF generation / day rebuild and O2 Ring filesystem I/O.
 *                 Mutually exclusive with other EXPORT work and with
 *                 DESTRUCTIVE work.  Allowed during recording (a mask-off
 *                 break starts a new session while the previous one still
 *                 needs exporting).
 *   DESTRUCTIVE — recreate/delete/reset/format.  Refused while recording
 *                 or while an export or upload is in progress.
 *   UPLOAD      — reads a day folder.  Excluded from concurrent EXPORT so
 *                 it can never read a day that is being replaced, and from
 *                 recording so a long reader cannot contend with raw writes.
